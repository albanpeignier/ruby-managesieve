0. INTRODUCTION
===============

Ruby-managesieve is a pure-ruby library for the MANAGESIEVE
protocol [1]. It allows programmatic control of Sieve [2] scripts, and
implements the following commands described in the MANAGESIEVE draft:

  * CAPABILITY
  * DELETESCRIPT
  * GETSCRIPT
  * HAVESPACE
  * LISTSCRIPTS
  * LOGOUT
  * PUTSCRIPT
  * SETACTIVE

The AUTHENTICATE command is partially implemented. Currently the LOGIN
and PLAIN authentication mechanisms are implemented.

Documentation is provided in the "doc" directory, and usage examples are
provided in the "examples" directory.

Some ideas from Ruby/ManageSieve were borrowed from
python-managesieve [3], the Python implementation and Net_Sieve [4], the
PHP implementation from the PEAR library.


1. REQUIREMENTS
===============

Ruby/ManageSieve requires Ruby version 1.8.1.


2. INSTALLATION
===============

Installation is straightforward: just run the command below (it requires
privileges to write in the ruby library directory).

# ruby install.rb

This command installs the managesieve library in ruby's site-wide
directory and the sievectl utility in ruby's bindir.

The sievectl utility is a small program that allows you to manage your
sieve scripts from the command line. To learn how to use sievectl, type
"sievectl help".
